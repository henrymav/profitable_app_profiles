    "# Developing profitable apps for the Android and iOS app stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be analysing data about apps in the Google Android Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to provide a recommendation for creating a profitable free-to-download app. This recommendation could be take the shape of: a list of criteria that make an app popular (prone to be downloaded) or a  category of app to develop. The recommendation should support a dev team in the creation of apps that make the most of a business model where revenue comes from in-app engagement and in-app purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [2020 article on Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/28/mobile-app-monetization-part-1-revenue-generation-models/), Kontsevoi outlined six revenue models from apps:\n",
    "- app purchase\n",
    "- in-app purchase \n",
    "- selling third party content\n",
    "- subscriptions\n",
    "- advertising\n",
    "- serivce fees\n",
    "\n",
    "He suggests that the in-app monetization model or 'freemium' model is becoming\" increasingly popular among app publishers\" and to consider \"mixing and matching in-app purchase types\" to meet the diverse needs of an audience. This article shows that there is potential in pursuing this type of revenue models for app development teams which makes this research project worthwhile.  "

    "This data was collected in 2017 and 2018. The mobile app market is highly dynamic and will likely have changed since then. This could influence the criteria used as a proxies in this research to measure app popularity (eg. downloads & user rating). As a result, the recommendations to inform the business decision of this project should be contextualized and may not be applicable to 2022 and beyond due to new trends and tendencies that have emerged since 2017.

    "Lastly, we should also consider that this dataset was first put together in 2017, and the proportion of each app genre to the total will likely have changed since then, when considering all apps in the Apple store. There have been additions to the Apple hardware ecosystem such as the 'Apple Watch' and 'Apple Pen'(both first released in 2015). These may have incentivised companies or development teams to create apps that are compatible and can make use of this hardware. It took the Apple Watch 4 years to reach 50 million users, but in the next two years, adoption increased to 100 million users, indicating an accelerated adoption rate ([Statista, 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1221051/apple-watch-users-worldwide/)). The adoption new hardware may have led to an increase in `Health & Fitness` or `Medical` apps being developed due to the ability to track health-related data. Furthermore, apps which use short nudging and notifications that can be displayed on the Apple Watch's screen such as `Education`, `Finance`, and `News` may have also gathered increased interest from development teams since 2017.

    "### The Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we found in the Apple app store dataset that `Books` was an interesting category to pursue with but the store is dominated by apps created for entertainment purposes. The `BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE` category from the Android app store is also worth exploring. Apps with content related to religious texts, translation, and educational material have quite significant download numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine these observations and patterns to recommend the development of an app which would offer a library of books or texts with the potential to bring the content to life in a engaging and playful way. This approach takes into account the high proportion of entertainment apps in both app stores but with potential for the higher percentage utility apps in the Android app store as it is the one that will be used for prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Texts targeted for a younger audience could have 'gamification' elements such as:\n",
    "- colouring\n",
    "- light quizzes\n",
    "- shortened versions\n",
    "\n",
    "and for adult and older audiences the new ways to bring content to life could be:\n",
    "- quotes\n",
    "- analyses\n",
    "- key points \n",
    "- taught classes to use frameworks from the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed solution to the development team would be to create an app that acts as a 'gamification engine' along with visually engaging User Interface elements to bring to life the content from books or texts. The book's authors or individuals with knowledge about religious texts or languages could create and contribute the content. This would relieve the need for in-house topic experts to create content while providing creators with a solution to create  gamified and interactive content through the app about a topic they know well. In the current mobile app market with high competition and marketing costs to get impressions, this solution could be more profitable than building standalone apps which could have high fixed and variable costs to develop and market. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is potentially a hardware ecosystem element to this solution. A colouring book could be immersive for families with smart pens for example. People with smartwatches could also get nudges in the forms of quotes or key points daily. This ensures we have a value proposition for which users can make the most of the ecosystem they have invested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The monetization element could come from affiliate links, selling source content books and related merchandise (classes & lectures, etc.) from which each book gamification element is based on. This could be coupled with the 'recommended books' based on user baskets and related purchases. These revenue sources will hopefully provide educational value for the app users. The intended educational value would shield our users from undesirable effects of in-app purchases such as in the mobile gaming industry - spending on in-game coins and elements that may not provide lasting educational value. The diversity of in-app purchases also aligns with the recommendation of the Forbes author to provide different options for users in order to make the app more attractive for repeat purchases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `Reference` and `Books`, this app proposal could be attributed to multiple categories such as games, education, entertainment, and family (in the Google Store). This would give it more exposure and make it present in categories with significant download volumes."

While there is potential to create a unique mobile app, a level of specialisation for content creation or app mechanics may be required to make it unique and attractive for users.

We observed that the free-to-download app market is quite contentrated and saturated so an original idea in terms of functionality and value-add for users is key to make the app popular but also get it approved on the app stores.  \n",
